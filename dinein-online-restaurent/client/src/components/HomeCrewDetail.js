      <p >CSS can be tricky, and at times, frustrating to work with. One of the things I had trouble figuring out was how to change the opacity of a background without it also affecting the opacity of the text it contained.
          For instance, let's say you have a parent div wrapped around some text and you wanted to change the opacity of just the div. You'd think that it'd be something as simple as the below.</p>
    </div>

export default HomeCrewDetails;
